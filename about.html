<p>I have been 'thinking' about doing a coding bootcamp for years, and now I've decided to take the plunge. I want to work towards making beautiful, functional websites, whose focus on the end-user makes them a joy to navigate. My drive is entrepreneurship and the independence of gaining a skill that I can take anywhere.</p>
