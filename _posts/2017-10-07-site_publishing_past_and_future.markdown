My first time working with HTML & CSS, I was an intrepid 13-year old spending hours to perfect my social media profile. Before smart phones and Facebook updates, Myspace was my desktop based portal to the outside world and its design elements were entirely up to the me! Without any knowledge or appreciation for the words “front-end” or “coding”, I poured over the HTML on my blog to insert the coolest background, glitteriest text to zoom around my page, and of course the best profile song. Those approximately two years before Facebook expanded beyond college-campuses were spent mostly surfing the internet and copy pasting anything that interested me into the code. My focus was entirely to have the best page of all the 8th graders and to wow any user that wandered onto my site. 

The next time I encountered HTML & CSS was ten years later, at a post-college job working for a small software start-up. I had been tasked with our “rebrand”, working with a designer to come up with a new logo and of course (sans-designer) redesigning the website. Turns out even the most basic of web design software are best utilized with some knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax. Even with constant googling, I was never quite sure when to use ‘Div’s, ‘Id’s and ‘Class’es. I eventually cobbled together a nice looking but chaotically structured front end. Then came the request for responsive! Without consistent internal structure, building responsive (even with a web page software) was a monumental task and when I finally left that role to return to school I was more than burnt out by the endeavor.

Given my mixed history with the topic, I was hesitant to approach this section of the curriculum. However, as I worked through the labs I come to appreciate how far the mark-up languages have come and am excited (rather than traumatized) by the prospect of applying them in our current, responsive world. I get to fuse the best my prior experiences with HTML & CSS. Turns out my completely uninhibited and undaunted 13-year old self wasn’t off the mark. HTML and CSS is all about the end user and highlighting content in ways that bring it life and are intuitive to navigate. Though maybe this iteration will require significantly less boisterous backgrounds and pink glitter. My anxious post-college grad self also deserves some credit – consistent structure and formatting are what make sites living and breathing and ownership easily transferred from one engineer to another. It makes everyone’s job a lot easier. 

Moving forward, though site publishing may not be the bulk of a future role (and who knows about that)—it’s important to recognize that no matter the back-end technology, if users do not enjoy the front-end experience then it’s all for naught. So here I am, my current self, gaining the knowledge necessary to satisfy the dreams and aspirations of my past versions. That’s pretty cool.
