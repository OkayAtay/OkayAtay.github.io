Today I’d like to talk about Perl, not ‘pearl’, the beautiful semi-aquatic gemstone, but ‘perl’ the ‘post-modern’ programming language. I do not know perl, probably could not even identify it in an imagined line-up of coding languages. But, perl is significant to me because I’m currently knee deep in learning its successor Ruby. In FlatIron school, we’ve learned that the creator of ruby wanted to build a language that was enjoyable to those using it. Yukihiro Matsumoto was once quoted saying,

> “You want to enjoy life, don’t you? If you get your job done quickly and your job is fun, that’s good isn’t it? That’s the purpose of life, partly. Your life it better.”

Mutsumoto apparently derived much of his thinking about ruby from the creator or ‘perl’, Larry Wall. If you have not yet read Wall’s “Perl, the first postmodern computer language”, I highly recommend it – it’s a joyride of linguistics, philosophy and a dash of computer science. I came away still knowing very little about the ‘what’ of perl, but I learned something I found even more intriguing, the ‘why’ of perl. Just like Ruby, at some level perl is more about the person using the code than the problem the code is trying to solve. I enjoy how Wall simplifies the post-modernist ethos; you use everything as inspiration (the modern, the old, the ancient), keep what you like, lose what ‘sucks’, and the only justification you need is that ‘it’s cool’.

Wall’s soliloquy about ‘Perl’ and post-modernism feels just as relevant, 20+ years later. The open-source movement continues to grow, we’ve found ourselves in a world where tech-companies are the biggest economic players, the value of cryptocurrency is skyrocketing, and the internet plays a massive role in most of our lives.

What I also really like is Wall’s discussion of diversity (a banned word now in some areas). He wrote: 

> “…the open source movement is energized by the other sort of joiner. This sort of person joins many tribes. These are the people who inhabit the intersections of the Venn diagrams. They believe in ANDs rather than ORs. they carry ideas from one intellectual tribe to another. I call these people ``glue people'', because they not only join themselves to a tribe, they join tribes together.”

In just the last 3.5 months of learning code, I’ve realized that what I’m absorbing is so much more than syntax and understanding logic conventions or the role of a compiler. I’m learning to solve problems differently and tapping to community that is diverse, that wants to understand the past, drive the future. It wants to be inclusive and create beautiful and ‘cool’ stuff; and it’s been great.
