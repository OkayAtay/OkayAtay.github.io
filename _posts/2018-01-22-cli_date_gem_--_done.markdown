I can't believe I just completed a workable CLI data gem.

I am a part-time student, so this feat took me just over a week to complete. Honestly at first, like most, I was overwhelmed by the task -- they're asking ME to create what??. Don't they know I'm still green at this coding thing. But after time spend at the weekend warrior workshop, the process become much more clear. I realized that planning is the key to avoiding becoming frustrated and overwhelmed. That being said, DON'T OVER PLAN! You will never know if your code works until you get out there and start testing it.

Once I figured out my structure and how I wanted my objects to interact, the majority of my time was spent trouble shooting. One particularly aggravating bit was updating an incorrectly scraped object and inserting it back into an existing array. 

I'm sure my code is rough and there's room for lots of improvement, but I actually am ecstatic that I was able to complete this first Final project.

Yay!
