Software development has always held a level of intrigue to me. Within a year of completing an undergraduate degree in political science, in my free time I was tinkering on sites such as Kahn Academy, Code-Academy, Treehouse, the online Harvard course CS50, and dreaming about quitting my job to delve into a full-time boot-camp program on the west coast. Honestly, it would have been a perfect time to explore those options; but my self-esteem was painfully low from experiencing the rejection of ‘real-life’ after what I thought was a stellar academic career. Where was my 6-figure salary and numerous job offers?!

So, I kept working, learned new skills, met new people, matured significantly and slowly regained confidence in my own abilities and potential. In this time, I’ve gone back to school, obtained a business degree and a job at a company that challenges and motivates me. However, the pull to software development remerged full force while attending the commencement speech for my younger brother’s college graduation. I listened to a prominent voice in the world of computer science and AI address the engineering school graduates and detail the upcoming ‘revolution’ in technology and computing. It was a strangely somber speech, more like a warning for these young graduates to be ready, to be innovative and to be part of --rather than blind-sided by these upcoming changes. “Every company is a technology company” the speaker said, a phrase that since that speech I have heard echoed from numerous leaders in business. 

From there, my next steps were clear. To be successful in, and prepared for this Brave New World an understanding and grounding in the technology that shapes our societies is essential. **Yes**, I want to code because it’s fun, and a mix of creativity and logic, a path to entrepreneurship, and will help build my career through acquiring a new skillset.  However, there’s something even bigger at play. Knowledge of software development is my entry-point to the inevitable (yessss, I know nothing is inevitable *see American political climate* but still—the ‘highly-likely’) tech-focused and AI-driven future and I want to be a participant, not a bystander.
