I'm just about half way through this coding journey with FlatIron and I definitely feel like I should be so much further. 
How come I couldn't get those 20 hours in every week while working full-time!? Will I ever finish, will my IDE ever work properly consistantly? Is it 50% IDE malfunctions and/or 50% spelling errors that are the source of my ire. After spending 4.5 hours on a single, non-essential lab I feel fatigued and seriously down on this process. But, maybe reviewing the concept of CRUD will make me feel just marginally better?

CRUD stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE.

The acronym easily summarizes much of what we are capable of doing while interacting with the web. However, amazingly, these four basic actions present a world of possibilities.

Create - allows us to build routes that render new views. These views can hold forms, or  pretty pictures of calming sunsets, or other things...

Read - allows to to deliver ALL instances of a class, or just one. So much to see...

Update - using the newly discovered 'patch' we can change the information created by the forms I mentioned in 'create'. Nothing has to stay the same forever!

Delete - get rid of those old ratty instances that are holding you back! 

Ohh, interesting tidbit -- the browser can only handle GET and POST requests, so we disguise DELETE and PATCH requests like sneaky code ninjas. In forms, the extra line of code <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE" or "PATCH">

In summary, don't be disheartened. Slow progress is still progress, and even if you're feeling like CRUD, remember you probably had no idea what that meant 4 months ago.

Happy coding.
